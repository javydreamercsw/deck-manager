OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Javassist (Java Programming Assistant) makes Java bytecode manipulation simple. \
    It is a class library for editing bytecodes in Java; it enables Java programs to define a new class at runtime and to modify a class file when the JVM loads it. \
    Unlike other similar bytecode editors, Javassist provides two levels of API: source level and bytecode level. \
    If the users use the source-level API, they can edit a class file without knowledge of the specifications of the Java bytecode. \
    The whole API is designed with only the vocabulary of the Java language. \
    You can even specify inserted bytecode in the form of source text; Javassist compiles it on the fly. \
    On the other hand, the bytecode-level API allows the users to directly edit a class file as other editors.\n\n\
    Aspect Oriented Programming: Javassist can be a good tool for adding new methods into a class and for inserting before/after/around advice at the both caller and callee sides.\n\n\
    Reflection: One of applications of Javassist is runtime reflection; Javassist enables Java programs to use a metaobject that controls method calls on base-level objects. \
    No specialized compiler or virtual machine are needed.
